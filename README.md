**PROBLEM STATEMENT : ONE-STOP PERSONALIZED CAREER ADVISOR**
#**📌 PS-Context**
Government degree colleges in India face declining enrollments not because of poor infrastructure or teaching quality, but
due to awareness and guidance gaps among students and parents.

👨‍👩‍👧 Families often don’t understand the long-term value of graduation, leading to preference for short-term skill courses or costly private colleges.

🎓 After Class 10/12, students are confused in stream selection (Arts, Science, Commerce) and how it connects to future careers.

🏫 There is limited awareness of nearby government colleges, their programs, eligibility, and scholarships.

💼 Students lack clarity on career outcomes (jobs, higher studies, growth paths) after graduation.

⚠️ This results in wrong academic choices, dropouts, or migration to private institutions.
